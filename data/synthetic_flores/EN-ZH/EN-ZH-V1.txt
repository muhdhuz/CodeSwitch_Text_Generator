Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: 生长抑制, 营养不良, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would have been 蛋白质 accessible in 叶子 and 豆类, but these are hard for 灵长类动物 like 我们 to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, 动物性食物 (ants, 白蚁, eggs) not only are easily digestible, but they provide high-quantity proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if 我们的祖先 solved their "protein problem" in somewhat the same way that chimps on the savanna do today.
睡眠中断 is 过程 of purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by 使用 a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on 房间的另一边, forcing you to get out of 床 to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking 大量 of 液体 (particularly water or 茶, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of 内心平静 一个人 possesses correlates oppositely to the amount of 紧张 in 身体 and 精神.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. 每个人 has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
每个人 can achieve 开悟. 唯一 standing in the way of this goal is 我们自己的紧张 and 消极.
藏传佛教 is based on 教义 of Buddha, but were extended by the mahayana path of 爱 and by a lot of 技巧 from Indian Yoga.
In 原则 藏传佛教 is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, 冥想 and the path of all-embracing love.
With 昆达里尼瑜伽 昆达里尼能量 (enlightenment energy) is awakened through 瑜伽姿势, 呼吸练习, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities 能量通道 are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
德国 was a common enemy in World War 2, leading to 合作 between 苏联 and USA. With 战争的结束 冲突 of 体系, process and 文化 led to the countries falling out.
With 战争结束两年, the former allies were now 敌人 and 冷战 began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by 代理军队, on 战场 from 非洲 to Asia, in Afghanistan, 古巴 and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along 罗马尼亚桥头堡.
However, 这些计划 were rendered obsolete nearly overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from 苏联红军 entered and created 白俄罗斯和乌克兰 fronts after invading 波兰的东部地区 in 违反 of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport 货物 is by far the most efficient way to move 大量人 and 货物 across oceans.
The job of 海军 has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains 能力 to move your people and 货物, while at 同时, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and 货物.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was 北大西洋战役 of WWII. 美国人 were trying to move 人 and materials across 大西洋 to help Britain.
At 同时, 德国海军, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had 盟国 failed, 德国 probably would have been able to conquer 英国 as it had 其他国家 of Europe.
山羊 seem to have been first domesticated roughly 10,000 years ago in 扎格罗斯山脉 of Iran.
Ancient cultures and 部落 began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, 肉, and 皮肤.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by 牧羊人 who were frequently 儿童 or 青少年, similar to 更广为人知的牧羊人. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in 英国 as early as 16 世纪.
Although wagonways merely consisted of parallel planks of wood, they allowed 马 pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day.
Crossties were introduced fairly early to hold 铁轨 in place. Gradually, however, it was realised 铁轨 would be more efficient if they had a stip of 铁 on the top.
This became common practice, but 铁 caused more wear on the wooden wheels of 马车.
Eventually, 木轮 were replaced by 铁轮. In 1767, 第一条全铁轨 were introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, 人类 began walking upright two million years ago with 出现 of 直立人 (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, 南方古猿 did not walk upright as habitually.
双足特化 are found in 南方古猿化石 from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly to the environment, we can join to 环境运动, and we can even be activists in order to reduce the future suffering in some degree.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, then we should find 问题的根源, and we should deactivate them.
It is obvious enough 世界 has changed much because of humankind's scientific and technological advancements, and 问题 have become greater because of 人口过剩 and mankind's 奢侈的生活方式.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress 约翰·汉考克 and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to 印刷厂 of John Dunlap.
Through the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as 邓拉普宽边".
The first public reading of 文件 was by 约翰·尼克松 in 院子 of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to 乔治·华盛顿 on 7 月 6, who had it read to his troops in 纽约 on 7 月 9. 副本 reached 伦敦 on 8 月 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of 文件. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
许多古生物学家 today believe 一群恐龙 survived and is alive today. We call them 鸟类.
很多人 don't think about them as 恐龙 because they have 羽毛 and can fly.
But there are 很多 of things about 鸟 that still look like 恐龙.
They have 脚 with 鳞片和爪子, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two back legs like 霸王龙.
Virtually all computers in 使用 today are based on the manipulation of 信息 which is coded in the form of binary numbers.
二进制数 can have only one of 两个值, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as 二进制数字 - or 位, to use 计算机术语.
内中毒 may not be immediately apparent. 症状, such as 呕吐 are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of 药物 or toxic household chemicals.
Check 标签 for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
虫子 is used by 昆虫学家 in a formal sense for this group of 昆虫.
这个术语 derives from ancient familiarity with Bed-bugs, which are 昆虫 highly adapted to parasitize 人类.
Both Assassin-bugs and 臭虫 are nidicolous, adapted to living in 巢穴或住房 of their host.
Across 美国 of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of 多发性硬化症 (MS), leaving it as the leading neurological disease in 青壮年.

Science’s main goal is to figure out 方法 世界 works through 科学方法. 这种方法 in fact guides 最科学研究.
It isn’t alone though, 实验, and 实验 is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking 问题, and making 观察 also guide 科学研究.
自然主义者和哲学家 focused on 古典文本 and, in particular, on 圣经 in Latin.
Accepted were Aristotle's views on all matters of 科学, including 心理学.

Many observed rhythms in physiology and 行为 often crucially depend on 存在 of 内生周期 and their production through 生物钟.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply 反应 to external periodic cues, have been documented for 大多数生物, including 细菌, 真菌, 植物, and 动物.
生物钟 are self sustaining oscillators which will continue a period of free-running cycling even in the absence of external cues.
赫希 and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was 遗传物质.

突变 can have 各种 of different effects depending on 突变的类型, the significance of the piece of 遗传物质 affected and whether 细胞 affected are 生殖系细胞.
Only 突变 in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while 突变 elsewhere can cause 细胞死亡 or 癌症.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying 风景, including 动植物.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, 钓鱼, 摄影, 观鸟, and 参观公园 and studying information about 生态系统.
An example is visiting, 拍摄, and learning about organgatuangs in Borneo.
Every morning, 人 leave small country towns in cars to go their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle 每个人 is somehow connected with, and supporting, a transport system based on 私家车.
科学 now indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislodged 生物圈 from one of its stable states that has supported 人类进化 for the past two million years.
每个人 participates in 社会 and uses 交通系统. 几乎每个人 complains about 交通系统.
In 发达国家 you seldom hear similar levels of 投诉 about 水质 or 桥梁 falling down.
Why do 交通系统 engender such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are 交通工程师 just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
交通流 is 研究 of 运动 of individual drivers and 车辆 between 两点 and the interactions they make with one another.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because 驾驶员行为 cannot be predicted with 百分百确定.
Fortunately, 司机 tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, 交通流 tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent 交通流量, 关系 have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
这些关系 help in 规划, 设计, and 运营 of 道路设施.
昆虫 were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade 敌人 more easily and find 食物 and mates more efficiently.
大多数昆虫 have 优势 of being able to fold 翅膀 back along 身体.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from 掠夺者.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are 蜻蜓和蜉蝣.
Thousands of 年 ago, a man called 阿里斯塔克斯 said that 太阳系 moved around the Sun.
有些人 thought he was right but 很多人 believed the opposite; that 太阳系 moved around the Earth, including 太阳 (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because 地球 doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?

人 have known about 基本化学元素 such as 金, 银, and 铜 from antiquity, as 这些 can all be discovered in 自然 in native form and are relatively simple to mine with 原始工具.
Aristotle, 哲学家, theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of 四种元素中的一种或多种. They were 土, 水, 空气, and 火.
This was more like 物质的四种状态 (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also theorised that they change into new substances to form what we see.
合金 are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on 元素周期表.
元素 like 钙 and 钾 are considered 金属. Of course, there are also 金属 like 银和金.
You can also have 合金 that include 少量非金属元素 like 碳.

月球的表面 is made of 岩石 and dust. 月球的外层 is called 地壳.
地壳 is about 70 km thick on 近侧 and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under 高地.
There may be more maria on the near side because 地壳 is thinner. It was easier for 熔岩 to rise up to the surface.
内容理论 are centered on finding what makes 人 tick or appeals to them.
这些理论 suggest 人 have 某些需求 and/or 欲望 which have been internalized as they mature to 成年.
这些理论 look at 什么 it is about 某些人 that make them want the things that they do and 什么 things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
两种流行的内容理论 are Maslow's 需求层次理论 and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, 两种行为 can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or gals).
This type of 经理 has 困难 making 不得人心的决定, performing disciplinary action, 绩效考核, assigning 责任, and holding 人 accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one morphs into an unrecognizable individual that feels he or she must change 一切 团队 has been doing and make it their own.
After all, 领导者 is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of 团队.
这种行为 oftentimes results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of 团队.
虚拟团队 are held to the same standards of excellence as 传统团队, but there are subtle differences.
虚拟团队成员 often function as 点 of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have 更多的自主权 than conventional team members as 他们的团队 may meet according to 不同的时区 which may not be understood by their local management.
存在 of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of 虚拟团队.
The “invisible team” is 管理团队 to which each of the members report. The invisible team sets 标准 for 每个成员.
Why would 一个组织 want to go through the time consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into 实践 is 创新.
When all available resources are effectively used across 组织的职能部门, 创造力和独创性 can transpire.
As a result, 过程 of 组织 working together to overcome 障碍 can lead to a new innovative process to serve 客户的需求.

实地考察 are a large part of any classroom. Quite often 老师 would love to take her students 地方 to which a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers 解决方案 with 虚拟实地考察. 学生 can look at museum artifacts, visit 水族馆, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing 实地考察 virtually is also a great way to reflect a on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year 学生 from Bennet School in North Carolina design 网站 about their trip to the State Capital, each year 网站 gets remodeled, but old versions are kept online to serve as 剪贴簿.
博客 can also help improve student writing. While 学生 often begin their blog experience with sloppy grammar and 拼写, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since 学生 are often the most critical audience, 博客作者 begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Also blogging "forces 学生 to become more savvy about 世界 around them." The need to feed 观众兴趣 inspires 学生 to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
博客 is 工具 that inspires 协作, and encourages 学生 to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day.
适当使用博客 "can empower 学生 to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet materials, 学生 can define 自己的立场 in 上下文 of others' writings as well as outline 自己的观点 on 特定问题 (Oravec, 2002).
