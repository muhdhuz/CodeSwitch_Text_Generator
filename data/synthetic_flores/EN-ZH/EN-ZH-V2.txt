Out on the savanna, it is hard for 灵长类动物 with a digestive system like that of 人类 to 满足 its amino-acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has 严重 consequences: 生长抑制, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would have been 蛋白质 accessible in 叶子 and legumes, but these are hard for 灵长类动物 like us to 消化 unless they are 煮熟.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, 白蚁, eggs) not only are easily digestible, but they 提供 high-quantity proteins that contain all 必需 amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be 惊讶 if 我们的祖先 解决 their "protein problem" in somewhat the same way 黑猩猩 on the savanna do today.
