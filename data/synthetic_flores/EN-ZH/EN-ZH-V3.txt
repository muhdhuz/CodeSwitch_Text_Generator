One of the most common methods used to 说明 社会化的重要性 is to draw upon 少数 不幸 cases of 儿童 who were, through neglect, 不幸, or 故意虐待, not 社会化 by adults while they were 成长 up.
这样的孩子 are 被称为 "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by 人 (usually their 自己的 parents); in 某些情况 this 孩子 遗弃 was 由于 to the parents' 拒绝 of a child's 严重 智力 or physical impairment.
野孩子 may have experienced 严重 孩子 abuse or 创伤 before being abandoned or running away.
其他 are alleged to have been brought up by animals; some are 说 to have 生活 in 野外 on their own.
When completely brought up by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of the particular care-animal, such as its fear of or 冷漠 to 人类.
While project based 学习 should 使 学习 更容易 and more 有趣, scaffolding goes 一步 beyond.
Scaffolding is not 一种方法 of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals whom are undergoing 一个 新 learning experience such as 使用 一个 新 电脑 程序 or beginning 一个 新 project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in 换句话说, 老师 is a 形式 of scaffold but so is 小 paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
虚拟 Scaffolds are 内化 in 软件 and are meant to question, 提示, and 解释 程序 that may have been to challenging for 学生 to 处理 alone.
Children are placed in 寄养 for a wide variety of 原因 that range from 忽视, to 虐待, and even to 勒索.
No 孩子 should ever have to 成长 up in 环境 that is not nurturing, 关爱, and 教育, but they do.
We perceive the Foster Care System to be a 安全 地带 for 这些孩子.
我们的寄养系统 is 应该 to 提供 安全 homes, 爱 caregivers, 稳定的教育, and 可靠 health care.
寄养 is supposed to 提供 一切 the necessities that were 缺乏 in 家 they were previously taken from.
互联网 结合 大众传播和人际传播的要素.
The distinct characteristics of 互联网 lead to 额外的 dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as 互联网的重要动机 使用 (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuing relationships” were also identified as 新 动机 aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to 网站.
录像的使用 has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, 面部 movements which last 几毫秒.
In particular, it is claimed 一个 can detect whether 一个人 is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
奥利弗·萨克斯, in 他的论文 The President's Speech, indicated how 人 who are 无法 to 理解 演讲 because of 脑损伤 are nevertheless 能够 to assess 诚意 accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting 人类行为 may be shared by 动物 such as 家犬.
二十世纪的研究 has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
突变 添加 新 genetic 变异, and 选择 removes it from the pool of 表达 变异.
Segregation and recombination 来回变动 between the 两个 pools with 每一代.
Out on the savanna, it is hard for 灵长类动物 with 消化系统 like that of 人类 to 满足 its amino-acid requirements from available 植物 resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has 严重 consequences: 生长抑制, 营养不良, and ultimately 死亡.
The most readily accessible 植物 resources would have been 蛋白质 accessible in 叶子和豆科植物, but these are hard for 灵长类动物 like 我们 to 消化 unless they are 煮熟.
In contrast, 动物性食物 (ants, 白蚁, eggs) not only are easily digestible, but they 提供 high-quantity proteins that contain 全部 必需 amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be 惊讶 if 我们的祖先 解决 their "protein 问题" in somewhat the same 方法 黑猩猩 on the savanna do today.
睡眠中断 is 过程 of purposefully awakening during your 正常 sleep period and falling 睡着 a short 时间 later (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by 使用 a relatively 安静 alarm 钟 to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you 发现 yourself 重置 the 钟 in your sleep, it can be placed on 房间的另一边, forcing you to get out of 床 to turn it off.
其他 biorhythm-based options involve 饮用 大量 of 液体 (particularly 水 or 茶, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, 强迫 one to get up to 小便.
The amount of 内心平静 一个人 possesses correlates oppositely to the amount of 紧张 in 身体 and 精神.

Using ships to 运输 货物 is by far the most efficient way to move 大量人 and 货物 across oceans.
The job of 海军 has traditionally been to 确保 that your 国家 maintains 能力 to move your 人 and 货物, while at 同时, 干扰 with your enemy's 能力 to move his 人 and 货物.
One of the most 值得注意 recent examples of this was 北大西洋战役 of WWII. 美国人 were 尝试 to move 人 and materials across 大西洋 to 帮助 Britain.
At 同时, 德国海军, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had 盟国 失败, 德国 probably would have been able to 征服 英国 as it had 其他国家 of Europe.

We can 开始 生活 more friendly to the environment, we can 加入 to 环保运动, and we can even be activists in order to 减少 the 将来的 suffering in some 度.
This is just like 症状 疗法 in many cases. However, if we do not only 想要 一个 临时 解决, then we should find 问题的根源, and we should deactivate them.
It is obvious enough 世界 has changed much because of humankind's 科学和技术 advancements, and 问题 have 变得 greater because of 人口过剩 and mankind's 奢侈的生活方式.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, 一个 手写 draft signed by the President of Congress 约翰·汉考克 and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to 印刷厂 of John Dunlap.

每个人 participates in 社会 and 使用 交通系统. 几乎每个人 complains about 交通系统.
In 发达国家 you seldom 听到 类似 levels of 投诉 about 水质 or 桥梁 falling down.
Why do 交通系统 engender 这样 complaints, why do they fail on 一个 每天 basis? Are 交通工程师 just incompetent? Or is something more 根本的 going on?
交通流 is 研究 of 运动 of individual drivers and 车辆 between 两点 and the interactions they make with one another.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is 困难 because 驾驶员行为 cannot be 预测 with 百分百确定.
Fortunately, 司机 tend to 行为 within a reasonably 一致 range; thus, 交通流 tend to 有 some 合理 consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent 交通流量, 关系 have been 建立 between the 三 主要 characteristics: (1) flow, (2) 密度, and (3) 速度.
这些关系 帮助 in 规划, 设计, and 运营 of 道路设施.
昆虫 were the  animals to take to the air. Their 能力 to 飞 helped them 躲避 敌人 more easily and 找 食物 and mates more efficiently.

两种流行的内容理论 are Maslow's 需求层次理论 and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, 两种行为 can 出现 as managers 开始 to 领导 their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to 保持 “one of the guys” (or gals).
This 类型的经理 has 困难 making 不得人心的决定, 执行 纪律 action, 绩效评估, 分配 责任, and holding 人 accountable.
At the other 端 of the spectrum, one morphs into an unrecognizable 个人 that feels he or she must 改变 一切 团队 has been 做 and make it their own.
After all, 领导者 is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of 团队.
这种行为 oftentimes results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of 团队.
虚拟团队 are held to the 同样的 standards of excellence as 传统团队, but there are subtle differences.
虚拟团队成员 often function as 点 of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often 有 更多的自主权 than 传统 队 members as 他们的团队 may meet according to 不同的时区 which may not be 理解 by their 本地 管理.
存在 of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also 一个 独特 component of 虚拟团队.
The “invisible team” is 管理团队 to which 每 of the members report. The 看不见的 队 sets 标准 for 每个成员.
Why would 一个组织 want to go through the 时间 consuming process of 建立 一个 学习 organization? One 目标 for putting 组织 学习 concepts into 实践 is 创新.
When all 可用 resources are effectively used across 组织的职能部门, 创造力和独创性 can transpire.
As a result, 过程 of 组织 working together to 克服 障碍 can lead to 一个 new innovative 过程 to serve 客户的需求.
Before 组织 can be 创新, 领导 must 创造 创新文化 as well as shared knowledge and 组织 知识.

Technology offers 解决方案 with 虚拟实地考察. 学生 can 观看 at 博物馆 artifacts, 参观 水族馆, or 欣赏 beautiful 艺术 while sitting with their class.
分享 实地考察 virtually is also a great way to reflect a on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, 每 年 学生 from Bennet School in North Carolina 设计 网站 about their trip to the State Capital, 每 年 网站 gets remodeled, but old versions are kept online to serve as 剪贴簿.
博客 can also 帮助 improve 学生 写作. While 学生 often 开始 their blog experience with 马虎 语法和拼写, the presence of an 读者 generally 改变 that.
Since 学生 are often the most 批判 读者, 博客作者 开始 to 努力 to improve 写作 to 避免 批判.
Also 写博客 "forces 学生 to become more savvy about 世界 around them." The need to feed 观众兴趣 inspires 学生 to be 聪明和有趣 (Toto, 2004).
